### The IXI Dataset
We utilized the preprocessed version of the IXI dataset, curated by [Junyu Chen](https://github.com/junyuchen245) using Freesurfer for standard MRI preprocessing. 
This version of the dataset can be accessed [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1-VQewCVNj5eTtc3eQGhTM2yXBQmgm8Ol).

# Implementation
### Train
To train the model, follow these steps:

1. Set the following parameters in `train.py`:
    - Learning rate (lr): 0.0001
    - Head dimension (head_dim): 6
    - Number of heads (num_heads): [8, 4, 2, 1, 1]
    - Image size (img_size): (160, 192, 224)


2. Execute `train.py` to commence training:
```python
python train.py
```
### Test
To perform testing using the same parameters as training, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the parameters in `infer.py` are set to the same values as used in training.


2. Execute `infer.py` to compute the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) score for each image across each anatomical structure. 
```python
python infer.py
```

3. The results will be saved in a `.csv` file located in the `Quantitative_Results` directory, facilitating further analysis.
